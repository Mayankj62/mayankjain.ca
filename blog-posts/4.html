					<div class="blog-content">
						<p>Humanity has been dreaming of creating intelligent inventions since as far back as 800 BC, when ancient Greeks wrote about mechanical 
							men created by the Gods. In the last century, technology has been progressing exponentially and has brought us to a point where that 
							dream of self-aware robots is no longer associated with magic. The creation of <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> has allowed us to create amazing 
							programs that can far surpass the abilities of any human.</p>

						<p>The key advancement in the field of artificial intelligence that allowed us to do amazing things like creating chat-bots and detect 
							malignant tumors was the discovery of <b>neural networks</b>. Before this, programmers created relatively simple regression models to 
							predict and classify data. However, these models had their limitations.</p>

						<h3>What are Neural Networks</h3><br>
						<p>A neural network is exactly what it says in the name. It is a network of neurons that are used to process information. To create these, 
							scientists looked at the most advanced data processing machine at the time — the brain. Our brains process information using networks 
							of neurons. They receive an input, process it, and accordingly output electric signals to the neurons it is connected to. Using 
							bio-mimicry, we were able to apply the architecture of our brains to further the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
						
						<br>

						<br>
						
						<p>Artificial neural networks recreate the structure of human neurons to process information resulting in much more accurate results than 
							previously used regression models.</p>
						
						<h3>The Parts of a Neural Network</h3><br>

						<br>
							<img src="images/4-2.jpg" alt="">
						<br>
						
						<p>A neural network is made up of 3 main parts:</p>
						
						<h3>Input Layer</h3><br>
						<p>This is literally the layer that inputs information for the neural network to process. Each circle represents 1 feature (a piece of information). This can be anything. It could be the square footage of your house for a house price prediction program, or the value of a pixel on a screen for a computer vision program</p>
						
						<h3>Hidden Layers</h3><br>
						<p>These layers do all the processing for neural networks. You can have as many of these as you want. Generally speaking, the more hidden 
							layers you have, the more accurate the neural network will be. Each layer consists of nodes that mimic our brains’ neurons. These 
							nodes receive information from the previous layer’s nodes, multiply it by <b>weight</b> and then add a <b>bias</b> to it. Each line in the diagram 
							represents a weight. That may sound confusing so here’s an analogy:</p>

						<p>Let’s say I want to predict my SAT score and I have gathered two pieces of data: the number of hours I prepared, and the breakfast I 
							had on the day of the test. These would go into the input layer. It’s quite obvious that the hours I spend preparing will have a much 
							greater impact on my mark than my breakfast (or everyone would ace the SAT). Because of this, the hours I spend studying receive a 
							significantly larger <b>weight value</b> to be multiplied by. Now, granted, there’s a chance that your breakfast may vary slightly impact 
							your score, so it will receive a much lower weight value.</p>
						
						<h3>Output Layer</h3><br>
						<p>This layer simply brings together the information from the last hidden layer of the network to output all the information you need 
							from the program.</p>
							
						<h2 class="text-break">· · ·</h2><br>

						<p>To sum up, neural networks take information from the input layer, process it in the hidden layers, and output the desired information 
							in the output layer. This whole process of running a neural network is called <b>forward propagation.</b></p>
							
						<h3>Training Neural Networks</h3><br>
						
						<p>After understanding the structure of neural networks, you may be wondering how a neural network knows what biases and weights to use. 
							Neural networks often start off with random weights and biases, but then train themselves over and over again till they reach peak 
							performance. They do this by calculating the amount of error they currently have. This is called <b>the cost</b> of the neural network. 
							This is calculated by finding the difference between the network’s prediction, and the desired result and finding the sum of those 
							error values’ squares (target - output)².</p>

						<br>
							<img src="images/4-3.jpg" alt="">
							<p class="image-caption">The squares of the difference between the prediction and actual value</p>
						<br>

						<p>In the graph, the red line represents the predictions of a simple neural network. The blue dots are the correct predictions. The 
							neural network calculates how far the predictions (red line) are from the actual values (blue dots) and squares it (creates the green 
							squares). It then adds up those squared values to give you the cost of the neural network.</p>

						<h3>Optimizing the Weights and Biases</h3><br>
						<p>The entire goal of training the neural network is to minimize the cost. Neural networks do this using a process called <b>backpropagation</b>. 
							This seems like a complicated word but its quite simple. As I previously mentioned, forward propagation is when you run information 
							through a neural network to give you a result. Backward propagation is literally the same thing but backward. You just start at the 
							output layer and run the neural network in reverse to optimize the weights and biases. The math is quite complicated and beyond the 
							scope of this article, but you can always go search the internet if you’re interested in learning it!</p>

						<h2 class="text-break">· · ·</h2><br>

						<p>While this article only covered the basic theory of neural networks, there’s a lot of advanced calculus and matrix operations that go 
							into actually performing all these complicated processes. There’s still so much more to learn — from types of neural networks (like 
							RNNs, CNNs, and GANs) to other important training calculations like gradient descent.</p>

						<p>The 21st century revolves around the use of data and artificial intelligence is the most powerful data processing tool ever created. Because of 
							this, <b>artificial intelligence will disrupt every industry.</b> It doesn’t matter if you’re a teacher, a chef, a lawyer, or a doctor. 
							Artificial Intelligence 100% has the ability to disrupt your industry. Don’t believe me? AI can create customized lesson plans for 
							students, design creative new recipes, draft up legal documents, and create highly accurate diagnoses of various medical illnesses. 
							<b>For better or for worse, AI is coming to change the world.</b></p>
