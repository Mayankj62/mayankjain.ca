							  <h4>Dataset Acquisition</h4>
							  <p style="text-align: left;">I wanted to create stories based on the Grimm Brothers' writing as they wrote a significant number of Disney's stories. I found a copy of one of their story books online.</p>

							  <img src="img/Icons/Data Processing Icon.png" class="hiw-icons">
							  <h4>Data Processing</h4>
							  <p style="text-align: left;">The text file full of the story was stripped of non-story material. Then the story was split by words to create a vocabulary for the AI. Any rarely occuring words were removed to speed up training.</p>

							  <img src="img/Icons/Data Split Icon.png" class="hiw-icons">
							  <h4>Training Data Creation</h4>
							  <p style="text-align: left;">To train the AI, it was fed a series of words, and trained to detect the next word in that series. The data was one-hot-encoded so that the AI could predict a probability of each word appearing next.</p>

							  <h4>Neural Network Architecture</h4>
							  <p style="text-align: left;">The neural network uses a bi-directional LSTM. This means that it will use what comes before and after a word to give it more context for a prediction.</p>
